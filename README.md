# Scripts

A set of startup and QoL scripts.

I only now started keeping track, so only two exist, but I'll be adding more soon :)


| Name | Description |
| :---: | :--------: |
| firefox.sh | startup |
| tty_lsusb_assosiate | links lsusb results to their corresponding tty device |
| esp32c3_serial_setup.sh | sets up the serial port connecting esp32 devices |
